# Welcome to Newport

## 21 Jul, 2021

Welcome to your new blog powered by Newport.  Start writing your blog posts in this directory, using markdown, and then run `newport build`.  Your static blog will be written to a folder called production and you just need to upload the contents of that folder somewhere that is capable of hosting a static site for you.  Some free options are:

1. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
2. [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/)

Happy blogging!
