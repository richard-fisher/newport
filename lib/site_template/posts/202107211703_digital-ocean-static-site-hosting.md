# Welcome to Newport

## 21 Jul, 2021

Welcome to your new blog powered by Newport.  Start writing your blog posts in this directory, using markdown, and then run `newport build`.  Your static blog will be written to a folder called production and you just need to upload the contents of that folder somewhere that is capable of hosting a static site for you.  Some free options are:

1. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
2. [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/)

Don't forget to update your email address and site title in the config.yml

You'll find plugins in the javascript directory.  If you develop any useful plugins for your own use please consider submitting a pull request to the [Newport GitHub](https://github.com/richard-fisher/newport)

Happy blogging!
